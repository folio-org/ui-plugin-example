# Change history for plugin-markdown-editor

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-plugin-example/tree/v0.2.0) (2017-05-22)

* Reorganise into a single git module, `ui-plugin-example`, containing many example plugins. (At this stage, "many" is two, but that should expand.) Change-logging (i.e. this file) is for the entire repository, and all plugins should be released at once with the same version number.
* Add a second plugin, `plugin-markdown-better`.

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/folio-org/ui-plugin-markdown-editor/tree/v0.1.0) (2017-05-17)

* The first formal release.
