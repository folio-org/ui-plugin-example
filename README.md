## Introduction

This source module contains the code for several [Stripes](https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-core/) UI plugins. They exists only to test the plugin support, and do _not_ provide useful functionality.

Each subdirectory provides its own Stripes plugin module:
* [`plugin-markdown-editor`](plugin-markdown-editor)
* [`plugin-markdown-better`](plugin-markdown-better)
